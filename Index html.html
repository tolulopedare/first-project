      <h3>About Tolu !</h3>
      
      <p>I got the inspiration to learn coding ever since i watched Jeniffer Opal, her Coding beginner story was really inspiring.</p>
    
     <p>Her first experience and being one of the Black women in Tech to be a web developer really motivited me to learn.</p>
  
      </p>I have always doubted myself about coding, but right from the moment i watched her story, i felt like i can do this.</p>
  
      <p>She made me aware that 'Coding for girls' was providing a free course, she supported and encouraged me to learn</p>
  
     <p>I must say, i have only started learning how to code but i am really enjoying it.</p>
  
     <p>Thank you to Jennifer and thanks to all my Course Tutors.</p>
  
     <p>If you are currently reading this and would like something to encourage you to code, please see Jennifer story below</p>
